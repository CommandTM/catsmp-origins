# Cat SMP Origins Official Download
## Info
The Cat SMP Origins are a set of origins used in the Cat SMP Minecraft server in it's fourth season. Each member has their own origin. This is an add-on to the popular Minecraft mod [Origins](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/origins), more specificy the [Forge release](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/origins-forge). This repository has two uses; to keep the files safe somewhere in a cloud location, and to allow the members to download their origins for single-player use.
